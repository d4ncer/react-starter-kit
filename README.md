# React Starter Kit

This is meant to serve as a very basic template to prototype React + Flux applications, based very heavily on 
[this excellent gulp starter kit](https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter). It comes with a dev build environment,
watchers, and an in-built server, via BrowserSync. 

**It is not meant to be used in production**

## Usage

You'll need gulp, which can be installed via npm

```bash
$ npm install -g gulp
```

After that, just run gulp in the root folder and you're good to go. 

```bash
$ gulp
```

## What's in the box

- Browserify + Reactify + Watchify for bestify builds
- BrowserSync for responsive testing and server
- Bourbon/Neat/Bitters for styles

The kit is lightweight and all the tools can be swapped out if you're more accustomed to use something else (LESS for SASS, Webpack for Browserify, etc)
